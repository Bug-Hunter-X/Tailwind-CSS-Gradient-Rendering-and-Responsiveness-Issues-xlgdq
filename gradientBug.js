```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality. However, if the gradient is too complex or uses many colors, it can lead to unexpected rendering issues or performance problems in older browsers.

Another potential issue is related to responsive design. If you don't specify the gradient's direction responsively, the gradient may look distorted on different screen sizes.
